// Test script to verify trip control implementation
// Feature 1: Disabled Trip Controls Until Start

/*
IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
======================

1. Added _isTripStarted flag to track trip state
2. Updated _startTrip() to set _isTripStarted = true when trip starts successfully
3. Updated _completeTrip() to set _isTripStarted = false when trip ends
4. Updated _loadCurrentTrip() to set flag based on trip status from database
5. Modified all trip control buttons to be disabled when !_isTripStarted:
   - Monitoring Start/Stop button
   - Switch Driver button  
   - Break Toggle button
   - Sync Local Data button
   - Manual IoT Sync button
6. Added visual status indicator showing trip control lock state
7. Changed button colors to grey when disabled

BEHAVIOR:
=========
- When trip status is 'assigned': Controls are locked (grey) and disabled
- When trip status is 'in_progress': Controls are active (normal colors) and enabled
- Visual indicator shows lock status with explanatory text
- Users see clear feedback about why controls are disabled

AFFECTED METHODS:
================
- _buildMonitoringControlButtons(): Now checks _isTripStarted
- _syncLocalDataToSupabaseOnly: Button disabled until trip starts
- _manualComprehensiveIoTSync: Button disabled until trip starts
- _startTrip(): Sets _isTripStarted = true on success
- _completeTrip(): Sets _isTripStarted = false on completion
- _loadCurrentTrip(): Sets flag based on DB trip status

VISUAL CHANGES:
==============
- New "Trip Control Status" indicator with lock icon
- Disabled buttons show grey background instead of normal colors
- Clear messaging about why controls are locked
- Status updates when trip state changes

This completes Feature 1 of the 5-part trip control system.
Next features to implement:
2. Push notification system for assignments and overdue alerts
3. Overdue tracking for non-started and incomplete trips  
4. Operator reminder system with reassignment capability
5. Enhanced workflow notifications
